          Sink your teeth into a delicious restaurant-style, hamburger recipe
          made from lean beef. Skip the prepackaged patties and take the extra
          time to craft up your own, and that little extra effort will be worth
          it. To make cheeseburgers, about 1 minute before burgers are done, top
          with sliced cheese; continue cooking until cheese begins to melt.
